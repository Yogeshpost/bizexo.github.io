MUMBAI has place for every one. Lacs of Gorkhas from Darjeeling, Sikkim, Doors, Seven States of North East and Northern Indian region like Bhaksu & Dehradun and neighbouring country Nepal have been migrating and settled in different parts of Mumbai & Maharashtra in search of livelihood and better life.

                  <b>Action Plan:</b></br>
                  <p><span class="highlighted">HERITAGE:</span> To identify and research gorkha achievers in Arts, Music, Sports and any other field & highlight their contribution & try to give recognition to their contribution to Indian culture & society by naming the public places in their honour. To bring awareness in other community with workshops, seminars & press conferences by highlighting Gorkha History, Culture & Contribution to the Nation& the world.. To organize workshop for our community specially our youth to educate and to make them understand that Socially, culturally & Politically Gorkha's are equally progressive Committee. </br></br>

                    <span class="highlighted"> “INDIAN GORKHAS ARE BONAFIDE CITIZENS OF INDIA”</span> We are Bonafide Citizens of India. Govt. of India recognized our mother tongue Nepali language under 8th scheduled of Indian Constitution as one of the language of Indian society. To qualify to be recognized we have passed many parameters like the numbers of population as Indian citizens, our history to prove us of being the son of soil, our social & cultural depth, broadness & richness, our contribution to nation building etc. As a recognized Indian Language Nepali writers & poets are awarded “Sahitya Academy Purashkar” every year by the Govt. of India. In every Indian currency the Promissory Noting also expressed in Nepali language. </br></br>
                      
                    <span class="highlighted">“ALL GORKHAS ARE NOT MIGRANTS”</span> India & Nepal not only share closest religious & Traditional links and intimacy but also share longest range of land boundary. Before British, these boundaries or border lands used to be controlled by different local Raja’s : under different rulers in different times. The Anglo-Nepalese War was fought between the Gorkha Kingdom of Nepal and the British East India Company as a result of border disputes and ambitious expansionism. The war ended with the signing of the “Treaty of Sugauli of 1816“ resulting merger of almost 30% of Land under control of Nepal Into British Indian territory. When British Indian took control of these lands after Treaty of Sugauli in 1816 the inhabitants of these lands also became the subject of British India with their land. Before British India, most part of the Indian states like Himachal Pradesh, Uttarkhand were under Nepal control. In fact once the expansion of Nepal rulers were extended up to Jhelam River. Parts of Bihar & Nepali populated Bengal also had same problem. Chunk of Bihari speaking people are citizens ofNepal, due to same geo-historical reasons. Lately Sikkim, once independent nation became part of India by merging with land.This was possible only due to pro India voting by Sikkim population in the referendum, majority of them being Gorkhas. </br></br>
                      
                    <span class="highlighted">CONTRIBUTION OF GORKHAS IN FREEDOM STRUGGLE</span>  Thousands of Indian Gorkha fought against British Government, actively participated in Freedom Movement of India led by Mahatma Gandhi. Gorkhas were the real force behind Azad Hind Fauj (INA) led by Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. Saheed Captain Durga Malla, Brave Gorkha from Dehradun was first Azad Hind Fauj member to be captured & hanged by British. His Statue in the premises of Indian Parliament, New Delhi is testimony of recognition & respect to his contribution and sacrifice for freedom of our beloved motherland. </br></br>
                      
                    <span class="highlighted"> CONTRIBUTION OF INDIAN GORKHA IN NATION BUILDING ECONOMIC:</span> Gorkhas are active participants of overall development & economic progress of India. Thousands of Gorkhas are putting their blood & sweat in contribution of nation building by working hard in Tea gardens, quinine plantation, coalmines & other industrial sectors from generations. Famous Darjeeling tea was a major source of earning foreign currency before globalization. We will find Gorkhas in every industry, town, and city of India working hard, and positively contributing to economy of the nation. It is a proven fact that Gorkhas are never a financial burden to any nation or society. </br></br>
                      
                    <span class="highlighted">SOCIAL & CULTURE:</span> Socially Gorkhas are blessed with liberal, generous, amicable simple way of life. Now the Indian society is trying to be more civilized & humane by propagating the overdue demand for justice & respect to women. But for Gorkhas: love, care & respect for women is very natural and a way of life practiced from centuries. We are the only community may be in the world where a father & brother touch the feet of daughter & sister. The girl is married & sent off by cleaning the feet (Goda dhuear bidai garnu) by full family : father, mother & brother. The girl in the family is always compared to Maa Lakshmi. Gorkhas has never been a social or economical liability to where ever they go or settle. </br></br>

                      <span class="highlighted">DEFENSE :</span> "If a man says he is not afraid of dying, he is either lying or is a Gorkha”.-Former Indian Army Chief of Staff Field Marshal Sam Manekshal </br></br>
                      
                      “THE GURKHASOLDIER:………Bravest of the brave,most generous of the generous, never had country more faithful friends than you.”--- "Professor Sir Ralph Lilley Turner MC, Gurkha Rifles in the First World War.</br></br>
                      
                      Protecting Mother India by joining Indian Army is like a way of life for Gorkhas. Thousand of Gorkhas are at service in various Defense forces. Hundred of Gorkhas have sacrificed their life protecting the sovereignty of India. The Gorkha sense of duty, fearlessness, courage,loyalty, dedication & sacrifice has no parallel in the world. Theworld salutes Brave, Fierce Gorkha warriors. Khukri, the signature of Gorkha weapon is respected, feared and adored by friends & foes equally. </br></br>

Currently there are 39 battalions serving in 7 Gorkha regiments in the Indian Army. </br></br>
                      
                    <b> “GORKHAS ARE NOT COMMUNITY OF WATCHMEN”</b> Like any other progressive community of the world, the Gorkhas are hard working, God fearing, sincere & honest citizen of the world. The Ethnology website counts more than 42 million (2012) Gorkha speakers worldwide, only 17 million within Nepal (from the 2001 census). </br></br>

                      There is poor section of citizens are in every community. Our gorkhas from financially weak back ground has migrated to different town & cities of India for livelihood like any other community. Gorkhas are blessed with agile body & brain, simple & clean heart; speed of cheetah, Strong Character of honesty, loyalty & faithfulness, enjoys the unquestionable trust & confidence of the world. Because of trustworthiness & honesty, Gorkhas are employed as safety & security personnel all over the world including high profile security of high profiled people like Indian VVIP’s & Royal family of Brunei. Patronizing Gorkha as watchman community is big injustice meted to Gorkha, due to lack of knowledge about our Gallant History, rich tradition & culture by other communities. But the brave heart gorkhas must not loose their heart. Due to lack of in depth knowledge, till recently Indian were regarded as just a nation of Snake charmers by Western countries. But today India has earned the respect of world community as one of the developing nation with the potential to be leader of the world. </p>
